## Introduction

**Frontier Modular** acts as a wrapper for [internachi/modular](https://github.com/InterNACHI/modular), providing the foundation for modular architecture within the Frontier ecosystem.

> [!NOTE]
> This package currently serves as a lightweight wrapper around `internachi/modular`. We are actively developing additional features and deeper integrations for future updates.

For comprehensive documentation on the core modular functionality, please refer to the official [InterNACHI/modular repository](https://github.com/InterNACHI/modular).

## Installation

```bash
composer require frontier/modular
```

## Roadmap

Stay tuned for future updates, including:
- Enhanced scaffolding for Frontier modules
- Tighter integration with Frontier Action and Repository packages
- Advanced domain-driven design tooling
